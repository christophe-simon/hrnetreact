<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![HRNet Screenshot][product-screenshot]]

This project was realized during my training as a javascript/react developer for a fictitious company wanting to update a jQuery-based application whose github repository is: https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P12_Front-end.

This application had to be developed with React and use a state manager. As this project counts only 2 pages, I chose Context instead of Redux.

### Built With

- Markdown, Html, Css, Javascript
- React, Context
- Git, Github
- VS Code
- Love :)
